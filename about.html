<p>Hello there! I'm GOKUL G, a first-year undergraduate student at Amrita University, Amritapuri, pursuing Computer Science. My journey so far has led me to explore the world of coding through Python, HTML, CSS, and Java—technologies that allow me to turn ideas into digital reality. I’m passionate about using software not just as a tool but as a medium for storytelling, creativity, and helping others grow in their journey too. Driven by curiosity and fueled by creativity,  aim to craft experiences that are both functional and beautiful.</p>
